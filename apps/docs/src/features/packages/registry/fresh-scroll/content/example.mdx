## Simple usage

This example demonstrates infinite scrolling functionality with dynamic content loading. As you scroll down, new items are loaded in batches of 5 with a simulated 2-second delay. A loading skeleton is displayed during data fetching. Once all 15 items have been loaded, an empty state is shown with the option to retry.

```tsx
 <FreshScroll<ContentItem>
      containerProps={{
        className: "flex flex-col gap-4",
      }}
      components={{
        content: ContentCard,
        loader: <Loader />,
        empty: retry => <Empty retry={retry} />,
      }}
      loadNext={loadNextWithEmpty}
    />
```
<FreshScrollExample />
