## Vision

Throughout my career, coding has not just been a day job but also a passion that keeps me engaged late into the night. It is during these hours that some of my most creative ideas emerge—ideas that I am eager to experiment with and develop further.

This platform is my way of **sharing those bursts of creativity with you**. 

Whether you're here to find inspiration or to learn something new, I hope these documents serve as a valuable resource. 

**Feel free to pick anything** that catches your eye and use it however you see fit. 

No license is required; everything here is open source, including [this project itself](https://github.com/).


## About

I'm a front-end developer, and let's be honest, front-end development can be chaotic. With millions of npm packages, frameworks, and dependencies, it sometimes becomes overwhelming—even headache-inducing.

> Make a front-end development cool, again, together. 


### Technologies

In these documents, you'll find the latest technologies and principles that I incorporate into my daily work. I'm particularly fond of React, and I predominantly use **Next.js**; hence, you won't find much about other frameworks here.

My essentials tools for every project:

- **Next.js** - Next.js has skyrocketed in popularity and is by far my favorite framework. Most of the content here is based on Next.js. However, if you prefer plain React, perhaps combined with Vite, you'll find that these snippets can be adapted to some extent for those setups as well.
- **Tailwind** - for styling, combined with the beautiful [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), which has greatly inspired my approach to styling
