# REAL-TIME CHESS APP

This app is a _real-time chess app_ that allows you to play chess with your friends.

Website: https://chess.danielbilek.com

Main stack:

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- Supabase for database and auth
- Tailwind
- Shadcn / Radix UI

**_THIS IS README ONLY REPO AND TO THIS DATE THERE IS NO WAY TO RUN THIS APP LOCALLY._**

## Why No Local Setup?

The decision to not provide a local setup for this repository is intentional. The application relies heavily on Supabase's real-time capabilities and complex database configurations that would require extra work to replicate in a simplified local environment.
