This app is a _real-time chess app_ that allows you to play chess with your friends.

Website: https://chess.danielbilek.com

Main stack:

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- Supabase for database and auth
- Tailwind
- Shadcn / Radix UI

_THIS IS README ONLY REPO AND TO THIS DATE THERE IS NO WAY TO RUN THIS APP LOCALLY._

Normally you would create your own supabase project and .env vars. However, copying supabase project is little bit tricky, so there is no way to run this project locally unless you reverse engineer the supabase project and other connected external services.
